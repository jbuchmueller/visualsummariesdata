1,0,0,Change in orientation,"Fish in swarms often move in the same direction. Finding when this common orientation changes towards another direction is an important task to researchers. 
In this task, you will identify the begin of all major changes in orientation of the movers. A major change in orientation happens, when movers turn from one common direction to another within a short period of time. <br> In the below animation, examples of suchs moments are given. Note, how the movers first begin to turn, then the majority has turned, then the turn is finished. 
<br>
As you have learned, a major change in orientation happens, when the movers turn from one common direction to another within a short period of time. In the upcoming task, please mark the moments in time where you think the movers start to turn towards a new direction by clicking on the respective moment on the Input timeline. You can select multiple times by clicking at different parts of the timeline. If you want to correct your selections, you can undo them step by step or completely using the respective buttons.

In this task, you will identify the begin of all major changes in orientation of the movers. A major change in orientation happens, when movers turn from one common direction to another within a short period of time. You will use a novel visualization to accomplish this task. PLease take some time to thoroughly review the annotated example. <br>

In the visualization below, major directional changes are expressed in wave patterns. A wave pattern can lead upwards or downwards. As soon as the wave pattern changes its orientation, the group takes a new common direction. The below example shows when such events occur.<br> 

In the next steps, it is your task to identify the orientation change events. As you can see below, these events always happen, when the majority of the lines start to change their direction, either from parallel to upwards or downwards, or from upwards or downwards to parallel appearing lines.  Each dashed line marked with „Orientation Change“ signifies such a major directional change point as you will be looking for in the task. <br> You can select multiple times by clicking at different parts of the visualization.

In the image above, you can see an example of such a visualization, which contains about 150 movers moving for over one minute. While the visualization might look unusual, this is how you can interpret it: Time flows from left to right, and every pixel represents one mover at a certain point in time.</p>
<p class=""has-line-data"" data-line-start=""6"" data-line-end=""7"">You cannot really see, where the movers are going, but there are other things to see in the image. We have outlined them for you in the image above this text. First, you can notice a curvy wave pattern as hinted in the grey pattern above the visualization showing two waves. The steeper the curve is, the more do the movers change direction. Conversely, when there is no curve, the movers move very uniformly in the same direction (see annotations above). Second, color indicates the speed of the movers - red means they are fast, blue means they are slow. Sometimes, as annotated above, a few movers start to slow down or speed up and the rest gradually follows them. You can see an example of this at the marked point, where a red triangle slowly forms, meaning some movers start to get red (fast) and more follow. As well, all movers can start to speed up or slow down at the same time. You will notice a change in colors, but since all movers do that together, no such triangle forms. Third, sometimes some movers are fast while the rest is slow, as you can see in the example with 20% fast movers. You can estimate the proportion by looking at an area and compare the amount of red to the amount of blue around a certain point in time.</p>
<p class=""has-line-data"" data-line-start=""8"" data-line-end=""9"">In the upcoming tasks, you will be asked to <strong>mark individual moments or intervals</strong> in time.

Sometimes, you can mark more than one point in time, so you can just click on multiple points. If you want to undo your last mark or even completely delete all of your selections, you can use “Undo”-Button. In another kind of task, you can even mark whole intervals. You do this by clicking on the starting point, then at the end point of the time interval you want to select. Your selection will appear in grey, you can drag it around or adjust its borders.
